<div>Sunway University Ensemble was founded in 2008 under the guidance of Mr. Rockie Siew. What started from humble beginnings of under 10 string players would gradually grow into the developed orchestra consisting of more than 100 existing musicians and alumni we see here today. The ensemble's aim is to develop upcoming musicians and give students a chance to play in an orchestra and work together with other orchestras.</div><div><br></div><div>Throughout the years, SUE has hosted multiple successful concerts and played with many other orchestras. Even during the pandemic, the ensemble managed to perform by adapting to the changes with virtual performances, working together with and assisting organisations such as Music Medicus International, Taylor's Symphony Orchestra, Monash Chamber Orchestra and much more, all in the name of spreading music to the public and cultivating a love of music not just for performers, but for the audience too.</div><div><br></div><div>The ensemble will always be looking to spread the joy of music and performing, so do follow us @sunuensemble on Instagram or Sunway University Ensemble on Facebook if you're looking to join or even collaborate with us to make beautiful music!</div>
